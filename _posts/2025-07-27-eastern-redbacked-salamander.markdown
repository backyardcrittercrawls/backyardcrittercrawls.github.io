<br>
The eastern red-backed salamander (or redbacked, or red-backed, or northern red-backed, and presumably any other variation on that name [^wiki]) holds a special place in me. It's not my favorite salamander (currently a toss-up between the marbled salamander and eastern newt). It's also not my most exciting amphibian find, with the the Oscar going to a chunky spotted salamander. It was, however, the first wild amphibian I've ever held and caught on my first real herping --- the hobby of looking for reptiles and amphibians in the field carrying an often misunderstood name --- trip and was the start of how I gained an appreciation for these critters. I felt it was only right to give these cute little guys their due and make them the subject of my first post! 
<br>
<br>
I was on a vernal pond trip with the Audubon Society when this guy first appeared on my radar. Our guide introduced us to the practice of gently flipping logs and other structures to find creatures hidden underneath. Amphibians that love the moisture and sun protection offered by these hiding spots can often be found this way, but it should always be done responsibly while following best practices.[^neb] We found one who quickly escaped into its burrow, and another that our guide picked up and show to us. There's just something about a salamander's big eyes and goofy body that I love so much! They tend to be gentle creatures and a great opportunity to learn how to interact with animals, especially given their sensitivity to temperature and contact.

## A Little About Them

### What are they like?
These salamanders usually get between 2.2-4.0 inches, or 58-91 millimeters for non-Americans. They typically weigh around 1.5 grams, or 0.053 oz. And no, I don't know what 0.05 oz feels like despite being raised on these units. Females tend to be a little longer on average (3.07 in/78 mm) than males (2.87 in/73 mm),[^amwb] but their physical sexual dimorphism isn't as pronounced as some other amphibians in the area (looking at you, American toads!). They have long, slender bodies and short legs with four toes each. Like many salamanders, they don't have lungs --- instead breathing through their skin via cutaneous respiration![^sdz] That's a big reason it's so important to prepare before handling them and limit handling time. 

<br>
A cool thing about these salamanders is that they're almost entirely unreliant on large bodies of water. In fact, they're one of the only amphibians in northern New England that don't really make use of bodies of water at all![^ori] Many amphibians lay their eggs and spend their juvenile stages in the water before metamorphizing to live on land. Instead of laying eggs in water, females lay eggs on land in damp places like under a rotting log or rock. Mom keeps careful watch over her clutch of 1-14 eggs that hatch directly into miniature adults after 6-8 weeks. After about 1-3 more weeks with mom, they're ready to tackle the world by themselves![^vhs]

<br>
Something especially cool about these animals is that they exhibit an obvious polymorphism. Polymorphism is when a single animal has several distinct phenotypes, or physical traits as a result of gene expression. These salamanders primarily come in two morphs: the red-striped morph displayed above, and a lead-backed morph shown below. The red-striped morph can be identified by (brace yourself) its red stripe down the back while the lead-backed morph is almost entirely dark red/brown. It's not known why the two morphs persist, but it seems the red-striped morph must have some benefits to offset their increase predation by birds thanks to that big red mark on their backs.[^jhpr]

The map above from the IUCN shows the current range of these salamander.[^iucn] They're mostly relegated to the northeastern United States and prefer moist forests --- especially along the small rocky hills we have in the northeast.[^ct] From my experience, you can often find them chilling out on or under damp logs and leaf litter.
