<br>
The eastern red-backed salamander ---or redbacked, or red-backed, or northern red-backed, and presumably any other variation on that name[^wiki]--- holds a special place in my heart. It might not be my favorite salamander (currently a toss-up between the marbled salamander and eastern newt). It's also not my most exciting amphibian find, with the Oscar going to a chunky spotted salamander. It was, however, the first wild amphibian I've ever held and caught on my first herping ---the hobby of looking for reptiles and amphibians in the field, carrying an often misunderstood name--- trip and was the start of how I gained an appreciation for these critters. As such, I felt it was only right to give these cute little guys their due and make them the subject of my first post!

<br>
I was on a vernal pool excursion with the Audubon Society when these guys first appeared on my radar. Our guide introduced us to the practice of gently flipping logs and other structures to find creatures hidden underneath. Amphibians that love the moisture and sun protection offered by these hiding spots can often be found this way, but it should always be done responsibly while following best practices.[^neb] We found one who quickly escaped into its burrow, and another that our guide picked up and show to us. There's just something about a salamander's big eyes and goofy body that I love so much! They tend to be gentle creatures and a great opportunity to learn how to interact with animals, especially given their sensitivity to temperature and contact.

After a few moments, our guide let the salamander go. As we watched it wriggle home under a decomposing log, I couldn't help but feel a bit awe-struck at how such wonderful and complex creatures could go unnoticed by so many. This encounter taught me to appreciate the many different creatures around us and inspired me to create this blog. I would love for more people to appreciate the wonders of the animal world around them and know cool critters don't just live in exotic safaris. Sometimes, you can find them right in your backyard!

## A Little About Them

### What are they like?
These salamanders usually get between 2.2-4.0 inches, or 58-91 millimeters for non-Americans. They typically weigh around 1.5 grams, or 0.053 oz. And no, I don't know what 0.05 oz feels like despite being raised on these units. Females tend to be a little longer on average (3.07 in/78 mm) than males (2.87 in/73 mm),[^amwb] but their physical sexual dimorphism isn't as pronounced as some other amphibians in the area (looking at you, American toads!). They have long, slender bodies and short legs with four toes each. As a member of the <i>Plethodontidae</i> family, they don't have lungs --- instead breathing through their skin via cutaneous respiration![^sdz] That's a big reason it's so important to prepare before handling them and limit handling time.

<br>
Something especially cool about these animals is that they exhibit an obvious polymorphism. Polymorphism is when a single animal has several distinct phenotypes, or physical traits as a result of gene expression. These salamanders primarily come in two morphs: the red-striped morph displayed above, and a lead-backed morph shown below. The red-striped morph can be identified by (brace yourself) its red stripe down the back while the lead-backed morph is almost entirely dark red/brown. It's not known why the two morphs persist, but it seems the red-striped morph must have some benefits to offset their increased predation by birds likely due to that big red mark on their backs.[^jhpr]

### Where do they live?

</figure>

The map above from the IUCN shows their current range.[^iucn] They're mostly relegated to the eastern midwest (mideast?), mid-Atlantic, northeastern United States, and eastern Canada. Before you ask, I have no idea why the US regions are so weirdly delineated and apologize to angry mounties about my lack of Canadian geography. They prefer moist forests ---especially along the small rocky hills we have in the northeast.[^ct] They hibernate during freezing winters in underground burrows and under stumps. From my experience, you can often find them chilling out on or under damp logs and leaf litter. Since they don't need to live near large bodies of water, they can spread out across forests and are often extremely numerous. If you live near an area where these salamanders reside, keep an eye out. Some studies suggest they comprise nearly as much biomass as birds or small mammals in many forests![^vhs]

### What's especially quirky about them?
A cool thing about these salamanders is that they're almost entirely unreliant on large bodies of water. In fact, they're one of the only amphibians in northern New England that don't really make use of bodies of water at all![^ori] Many amphibians lay their eggs and spend their juvenile stages in the water before metamorphosing to live on land. Instead of laying eggs in water, females lay eggs on land in damp places like under a rotting log or rock as seen below.[^mst] Mom keeps careful watch over her clutch of 1-14 eggs that hatch directly into miniature adults after 6-8 weeks. After about 1-3 more weeks with mom, they're ready to leave the nest and tackle the world![^vhs]

### How are they doing?
Fortunately, eastern red-backed salamanders are currently listed as least concern on the IUCN Red List for endangered species.[^iucn] They aren't quite as susceptible to the carnage of Big Night ---a wonderful rainy night when amphibians emerge from brumation in search of vernal ponds to lay eggs in, sadly resulting in slaughter by raging cars as these creatures brave the roads[^harr]--- due to being terrestrial. It's not all sunshine and roses though. A study based on their metabolic rate conducted by David Munoz suggests they lower their metabolic rate in response to warmer climates, causing them to experience less growth by the time autumn rolls around.[^mun] This may affect how they respond to warming due to climate change, which is concerning given how prevalent this species is. They are definitely important creatures to monitor to understand climate change effects in woodlands going forward.

## Final Thoughts
I really appreciate these creatures; without them, I don't think this blog would exist. Seeing people's eyes light up when they find one of these common creatures brings so much joy to my heart. I especially admire how they've learned to thrive in a terrestrial niche despite nearly all other salamanders being semi-aquatic. They show us how finding our niche allows us to succeed in the world. Their multiple coexisting morphs make me hope we can all get along no matter what we look like. These critters are truly a backyard treasure, and I hope you get to interact with one soon!
