            This blog was created to share my adventures for wildlife with the world. I wanted to show that wonderful creatures could be discovered in even in mundane places. You don't need to journey to exotic places to discover the outdoor wonders; amazing animals can be found in everyone's neighborhood!

            My posts are all about animals I encounter locally. They mainly feature locations from the Northeast and Southwest USA, but I will document the special creatures I come across anywhere I go!

            <b>Disclaimer:</b> I am not a biologist, zoologist, ecologist, or any other -ogist. I do my best to cite my sources and research more than I know about the animals, but things can slip through and I may be incorrect about things. I'm happy to receive corrections if so!
